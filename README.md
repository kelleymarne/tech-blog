## Description

> Challenge #14 Tech Blog MVC

## Introduction 
This week we were instructed to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

## Challenges

The main challenges I ran into this week were my server session setup and the exorbant file tree we have now.

Durring the moduals I struggled to set up my session and get it up and running. I finally got it all squared away and working properly.

The large file tree made it extra difficult to navigate where i started in the debugging process. With the handlebars adding on to each other it made the file paths a little tricky for me. Making sure i had the correct index files in each folder was also tricky to keep track of. It is very overwhelming to have about 20 different places to look for erros. However i really am enjoying the MVC approach.

## Victories

Though the large file tree made for a difficult navigation on the develop end, I really am loving the MVC model approach and how it all functions together. I like that its a pretty standard set up and it was extremely helpful to be able to have the module assingments to reference back on this project. There are a lot of bare bones that are transferable with projects in this approach and that definitley eased the anxiety of the massive file amounts that i had to set up.
